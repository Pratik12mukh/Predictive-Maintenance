Introduction
This project aims to develop a predictive maintenance model that can help identify equipment failures before they occur. By leveraging historical maintenance data and sensor readings, the model can detect patterns and anomalies indicative of potential failures. This proactive approach allows for timely maintenance and reduces unplanned downtime, improving operational efficiency.

Modify the code as needed to fit your specific dataset and requirements.

Data Collection
Before starting the analysis, gather historical maintenance data, sensor readings, and other relevant information from the equipment. It is crucial to have a dataset that includes both normal and failure instances for accurate predictive maintenance.

Data Preprocessing
Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Use libraries like pandas and NumPy for data cleaning and preprocessing tasks. Drop columns or rows with missing values or impute values based on your project requirements.

Feature Engineering
Create new features from the existing data to improve the predictive power of the model. Compute statistical measures, extract time-based features, and incorporate domain-specific knowledge to derive meaningful features.

Time Series Analysis
Analyze the time series data to identify patterns, trends, and seasonality. Perform autocorrelation analysis, seasonality analysis, and trend analysis to understand the underlying patterns in the data.

Anomaly Detection
Detect anomalies in the data using statistical methods, clustering-based methods, or machine learning-based methods. Flag data points that deviate significantly from the expected behavior, indicating potential equipment failures.

Model Selection
Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm for predicting equipment failure. Consider algorithms like Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Gradient Boosting. Adjust the code based on your chosen algorithm and specific requirements.

Model Training
Split the preprocessed data into training and testing sets. Train the selected machine learning model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the testing set. Fine-tune the model parameters as needed to achieve optimal results.
